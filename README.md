# TO-DO-List-App
## My first note-taking app TODO-List. Full-fledged work with the ability to save data in the device's memory.

The application is designed to create and store various tasks and notes.
Implemented the simplest functionality for adding tasks, the possibility of their execution and deletion.
The functionality of saving application data using JSON encoding by signing under the Codable protocol has been implemented.

### An example of the application is shown in the figures below:
